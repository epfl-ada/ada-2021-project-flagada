Article scientifique sort : Differential climate impacts for policy-relevant limits to global warming: the case of 1.5 °C and 2 °C
European researchers have found substantially different climate change impacts for a global warming of 1.5°C and 2°C by 2100, the two temperature limits included in the Paris climate agreement. The additional 0.5°C would mean a 10-cm-higher global sea-level rise by 2100, longer heat waves, and would result in virtually all tropical coral reefs being at risk.

## November the 3rd 2016
Huge spike in frequency but very low count.
The Emissions Gap Report 2016 -> huge spike in 2016, 1 year after the Paris agreement, but since then, the same kind of report has been released every year but this is not viewable in the graph. 01/11/2017, 27/11/2018, 26/11/2019. This might be due to the fact that one year after the conference, the topic was still trending and it would attract clicks to talk about this report that showed that despite the measures taken at COP21, nothing has changed and the situation is worse than ever. We can hypothesize that the next year, when a similar report came in it was less relevant for the newspapers to talk about it as it was just "déjà vu".
