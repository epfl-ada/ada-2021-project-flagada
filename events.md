# Events with the most quotes related to climate change

## November the 3rd 2016
The Emissions Gap Report 2016 -> huge spike in 2016, 1 year after the Paris agreement, but since then, the same kind of report has been released every year but this is not viewable in the graph. 01/11/2017, 27/11/2018, 26/11/2019. This might be due to the fact that one year after the conference, the topic was still trending and it would attract clicks to talk about this report that showed that despite the measures taken at COP21, nothing has changed and the situation is worse than ever. We can hypothesize that the next year, when a similar report came in it was less relevant for the newspapers to talk about it as it was just "déjà vu".
