## Abstract 


Climate change has becoming a real threat the last decades. At the same time, populations start to be aware of it and the climate debate is diffusing around the world. Here, with the Quotebank data set, it is possible to map the relation between the impacts of climate change and the public opinion. The last reports of the IPCC and the COP conferences might highlight a really step towards the environmental transition from the world leaders. This project aims to study how much the climate debate has inflated along the years. Using the Quotebank dataset, we can analyse how much climate change is dealt in the press, according to different factors. Comparing these factors can help understand what are the reasons people talk about these issues. Is it catastropheses, Greta Thunberg's speeches, political parties statements, street demonstrations...? Many reasons lead to these debates and this project can help people caring about the environment to understand how and when it takes over the public discussion.

## Research questions

Our first question would be to study the impact of climate related events on the number of quotes about climate change. How much does a speech of Donald Trump on fossil fuels stimulate the number of quotes related to the environment? This would be an example of questions that can be answered by such an analysis. We can then classify these type of events and study which ones have the biggest impacts on the public press. 

## Methods

We first start with a sanity check to remove all data rows with an unreadable date. Then we add a column to the data set containing the day of the week. Then we set up a list of keywords allowing to distinguish quotes from one another.
