# ADA Project 

## Abstract 

The media have important influence over our daily lives. Even until recently, the information channels in societies were often used as means of propaganda to control the opinion. Even though the press has arguably become more objective with the arrival of internet and globalisation, they can still have a lasting effect on populations. In the frame of this project, the goal is to determine wheter the NY Times journal can have such effects according to the day of the week. Using the Quotebank dataset, one can look for correlations between the day of the week and the themes discussed in articles. This goal can help to validate established studies on psychology. Indeed, the impact of the day of the week has been discussed and this project can help to provide further evidence on their conclusions. If at somepoint I would be more interested in joyful news, when should I read the newspaper ? If I want a recap of the serious news of the week, should I read it on Friday or on Sunday?

## Research questions

Can we find significant variations on the nature of quotes according to the day of the week ? Is it in adequation with recent studies on psychology ? Does religion play a role with its religious days such as Shabat ? SOME CAN BE ADDED

## Methods

We first start with a sanity check to remove all data rows with an unreadable date. Then we add a column to the data set containing the day of the week. Then we set up a list of keywords allowing to distinguish quotes from one another.
